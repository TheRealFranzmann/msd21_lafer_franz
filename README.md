# Encryption by Franz Lafer

Hello! Thank you for downloading my encryption program!


## Basic info 

With this program you can encrypt and decrypt any text you can imagine.
This program works with the caesar encryption. It just takes the alphabet and rotates
the letters in the alphabet with the number the user gives the program.

## What do I need to run this program?

You just have to install the latest java version. That's all.

## How to 

When you start the program you get 3 choices:

- "1 - Encrypt text"


Here you can enter a rotation of how many letters you want to go forward in the 
alphabet and afterwards you can enter any text you want to encrypt it.

- "2 - Decrypt text"

Here you can enter a rotation of how many letters you want to 
go backwards in the alphabet and afterwards you can enter an encrypted
text to decrypt it.

- "9 - Quit program"

Here you can just quit the program.

## About me

I am a junior developer from Styria and I hope you have fun with my little
simple program.
